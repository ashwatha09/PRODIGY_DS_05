Traffic Accident Data Analysis
Welcome to the Traffic Accident Data Analysis repository! This project involves analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. We aim to identify accident hotspots and contributing factors through comprehensive analysis and visualization.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the factors contributing to traffic accidents and visualize accident hotspots. We explore how various elements such as road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day impact accident frequency and severity.

Dataset
For this analysis, we use a dataset containing records of traffic accidents. The dataset includes information on:

Accident ID: Unique identifier for each accident.
Location: Geographical coordinates or address of the accident.
Date and Time: Date and time of the accident.
Weather Conditions: Weather conditions at the time of the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy).
Road Conditions: Condition of the road (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
Accident Severity: Severity of the accident (e.g., minor, serious, fatal).
Contributing Factors: Factors that contributed to the accident (e.g., speeding, distracted driving).
Objectives
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Convert date and time into meaningful features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of accidents by road conditions, weather, and time of day.
Identify patterns and trends in accident frequency and severity.
Visualization:

Create heatmaps to visualize accident hotspots.
Plot trends and distributions related to weather conditions, road conditions, and time of day.
Use scatter plots and bar charts to display contributing factors.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provide insights into high-risk conditions and times.
Suggest potential measures for improving road safety.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need Jupyter Notebook for running the notebooks.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-accident-analysis.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd traffic-accident-analysis
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Analysis
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open data_preprocessing.ipynb and eda_analysis.ipynb from the Jupyter interface to follow along with data preparation, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

Generate Visualizations:

Run the visualizations.py script to create and save visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors.

bash
Copy code
python visualizations.py
Key Findings
Accident Hotspots: Heatmaps reveal areas with high accident frequencies, indicating potential high-risk zones.
Weather Impact: Analysis shows how different weather conditions affect accident rates, with severe weather correlating with higher accident severity.
Road Conditions: Certain road conditions, such as icy roads, are associated with increased accident frequency and severity.
Time of Day: Trends in accident frequency based on time of day, highlighting peak periods of accidents.
